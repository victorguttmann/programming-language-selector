Programming Language Selector

This is supposed to be a JS/HTML/CSS form site that gathers inputs from a user and outputs something based on their entry, although the assignment literally says it's ok if it uses no logic whatsoever based on the user's inputs so i don't even know what i'm really trying to achieve here. Either way, it didn't work. The JS won't load, won't show things, won't interact. Not sure what is going on, tried to debug it for hours across the weekend. Deleted entire sections and replaced it with older projects and changed variable names and it still didn't work. Showed it to someone, they couldn't figure it out. I give up.
