Programming Language Selector

This is a JS/HTML/CSS form site that gathers 2 inputs from a user - their name and Question number 3. Questions 1 and 2 are useless and nothing is done with the info.

This is like version 10 after nothing ever worked. Current known issues: It doesn't actually use real logic or anything valuable in any way.
